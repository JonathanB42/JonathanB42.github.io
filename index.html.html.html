<span class="s1">my bachelor's degree in Marketing. I have been following Football for almost 10 years now. I created this website as a way to interact with other fans</span>
<span class="s1">and share my many (and usually wrong) opinions about the sport that we love.</span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="s0">&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="s1">As mentioned above, I have been following The Premier League for almost 10 years. Growing up in Canada I did not have a lot of influence to get involved</span>
<span class="s1">in Football as it is not nearly as popular at home as it is in other parts of the world. I still remember the day that I fell in love with the sport. I had been</span>
<span class="s1">playing in an indoor winter league for a few years and wanted to watch a professional game, so I turned on the TV one Saturday morning and watch Manchester United</span>
<span class="s1">Vs Derby County. I believe the match ended 0-0 but what really spoke to me was what they showed during the half-time break, a montage of the Arsenal Invincibles.</span>
<span class="s1">Watching the way they played is what truly helped me appreciate the beautiful game for what it is.</span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
