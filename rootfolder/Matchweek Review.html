<h2>Newcastle United Vs Liverpool</h2>
<p>Liverpool travelled to an inform Newcastle in their race to beat Manchester City to the title this season. In a hard fought 1-0 victory for Liverpool
with Naby Keita scoring the winner it was Joe Gomez filling in at right back who had the most impressive display. Liverpool will still need to rely on
Manchester City to drop points but Liverpool is doing well to keep up with them</p>
<h2>Wolves Vs Brighton</h2>
<p>Wolves hosted Brighton who have been having quite a good season and continues that form with a 3-0 win over the wanderers. A great team performance away from
home which saw them scoring for fun, something you can rarely say about Brighton. If they have solved their finishing issues they could be quite a force next season </p>
<h2>Aston Villa Vs Norwich</h2>
<p>Aston Villa managed a close 2-0 home victory over already relegated Norwich City. A late goal from Danny Ings sealed the result and also sealed Norwich's fate
of playing in The Championship once again next season.</p>
<h2>Watford Vs Burnley</h2>
<p>Watford hosted fellow relegation candidates Burnley but were dispatched by a score of 1-2. Burnley have had a rise in form since the sacking of their long time manager
Sean Dyche and look like they will be staying up this season at the expenses of Everton.</p>
<h2>Southampton Vs Crystal Palace</h2>
<p>Crystal Palace travelled to Southapmton and beat the hosts by a score of 2-1 with a 90th minute winner by star player Wilfried Zaha. Palace have had a great season
when it comes to playing the big dogs in the league but seem to struggle when it comes to the teams around them, this result is an important step in looking to fix that issue</p>
<h2>Leeds United Vs Manchester City</h2>
<p>Title favourites Manchester City visitied the home of Leeds United and beat them comfortably 4-0. Believe it or not this was an imporvment on the reverse ficture which
saw Leeds fall 7-0 to the reigning champions. While Leeds still look comfortable in the relegation battle they need to worry about strengthening in the summer or their time
in the league may come to a close.</p>
