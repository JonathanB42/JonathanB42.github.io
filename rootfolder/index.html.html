<H1>About Me</H1>
<img src="headshot.jpg"/>
<p>My name is Jonathan Bayne, I'm a 23 year old Football fan from Toronto, Canada. I am currently living in Sligo, Ireland completing the last year of
my bachelor's degree in Marketing. I have been following Football for almost 10 years now. I created this website as a way to interact with other fans
and share my many (and usually wrong) opinions about the sport that we love.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, I have been following The Premier League for almost 10 years. Growing up in Canada I did not have a lot of influence to get involved
in Football as it is not nearly as popular at home as it is in other parts of the world. I still remember the day that I fell in love with the sport. I had been
playing in an indoor winter league for a few years and wanted to watch a professional game, so I turned on the TV one Saturday morning and watch Manchester United
Vs Derby County. I believe the match ended 0-0 but what really spoke to me was what they showed during the half-time break, a montage of the Arsenal Invincibles.
Watching the way they played is what truly helped me appreciate the beautiful game for what it is.</p>
