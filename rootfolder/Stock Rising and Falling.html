<h1>Stock Rising and Falling</h1>
<h2>Stock Rising</h2>
<h3>Gabriel Jesus</h3>

<p>Jesus has seen an uptick in from over the last two weeks after his links to Arsenal, scoring 4 goals in his last outing and 1 against Leeds this week. In
addition to this he also scored a crucial goal in Manchester City's 4-3 win over Real Madrid in the UCL Semi Finals </p>
<h3>Ben Mee</h3>

<p> After the sacking of long term manager Sean Dyche Burnley looked set to go back down to The Championship for the first time in almost a decade. Since
his sacking and the appointment of captain Ben Mee as caretaker manager Burnley have performed very well and look to be staying up in The Premier League for
another season</p>
<h2>Stock Falling</h2>
<h3>Phillipe Coutinho</h3>

<p> After an electric start to his return to The Premier League Coutinho's form has fallen off of a cliff. Villa looked set for a strong finish to their first
season without talisman Jack Grealish but it looks like it will be a dissapointing bottom half of the table finish.</p>
<h3>Illan Meslier</h3>

<p>It's hard to put a young goalkeeper in the stock falling but it seems necessary with some of the goals that Meslier let in against Manchester City this weekend.
He is a promising young goalkeeper and most experienced keepers will struggle to keep a clean sheet against Manchester City but he could be doing better.</p>
