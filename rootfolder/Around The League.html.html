<span class="s0">&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="s1">With the results of this matchweek it is now official that Norwich City will be spending next season back in The Championship. This is the 3rd straight time that</span>
<span class="s1">Norwich have come into The Premier League and been relegated in their first season. Many say that these so called &quot;yo-yo teams&quot; are bad for the league. Others would</span>
<span class="s1">say that it is a testement to how difficult it is to stay in the top division of English Football.</span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="s0">&lt;h2&gt;</span><span class="s1">Everton Going Down?</span><span class="s0">&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;img </span><span class="s2">src</span><span class="s3">=&quot;everton.webp&quot;</span><span class="s0">/&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;p&gt; </span><span class="s1">Everton are one of the six teams left that have never been relegated from The Premier League, the other five being the members of &quot;the big 6&quot; bar Manchester City.</span>
<span class="s1">It is hard to imagine The Premier League without two Merseyside Derbies each season, but it is looking more and more likely that the sudden departure of Carlo Anchelotti</span>
<span class="s1">and the appointment of Frank Lampard have been detrimental to Everton's chances of staying in the league.</span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;h2&gt;</span><span class="s1">City Still Strong</span><span class="s0">&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;img </span><span class="s2">src</span><span class="s3">=&quot;city.jpg&quot;</span><span class="s0">/&gt;</span>
<span class="s0">&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="s1">Manchester City are a powerhouse that almost no one in this league can match, Liverpool have had their best team in decades over the past 5 years but have only managed</span>
<span class="s1">to come away with 1 Premier League title due to the dominance of this City team. With Liverpool still trailing City by one point with 4 games remaining for each team</span>
<span class="s1">it looks unlikely that they will be caught. Liverpool's only hope is Aston Villa who has former Liverpool players Coutinho and Gerrard who will most certainly be up for</span>
<span class="s1">helping their former team win the title.</span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
