<span class="s1">addition to this he also scored a crucial goal in Manchester City's 4-3 win over Real Madrid in the UCL Semi Finals </span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="s1">his sacking and the appointment of captain Ben Mee as caretaker manager Burnley have performed very well and look to be staying up in The Premier League for</span>
<span class="s1">another season</span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>

<span class="s0">&lt;p&gt;</span><span class="s1">It's hard to put a young goalkeeper in the stock falling but it seems necessary with some of the goals that Meslier let in against Manchester City this weekend.</span>
<span class="s1">He is a promising young goalkeeper and most experienced keepers will struggle to keep a clean sheet against Manchester City but he could be doing better.</span><span class="s0">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
