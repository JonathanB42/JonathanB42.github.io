<h1>Around The League</h1>

<h2>Norwich Relegated</h2>

<p>With the results of this matchweek it is now official that Norwich City will be spending next season back in The Championship. This is the 3rd straight time that
Norwich have come into The Premier League and been relegated in their first season. Many say that these so called "yo-yo teams" are bad for the league. Others would
say that it is a testement to how difficult it is to stay in the top division of English Football.</p>

<h2>Everton Going Down?</h2>

<p> Everton are one of the six teams left that have never been relegated from The Premier League, the other five being the members of "the big 6" bar Manchester City.
It is hard to imagine The Premier League without two Merseyside Derbies each season, but it is looking more and more likely that the sudden departure of Carlo Anchelotti
and the appointment of Frank Lampard have been detrimental to Everton's chances of staying in the league.</p>
<h2>City Still Strong</h2>
<img src="city.jpg"/>
<p>Manchester City are a powerhouse that almost no one in this league can match, Liverpool have had their best team in decades over the past 5 years but have only managed
to come away with 1 Premier League title due to the dominance of this City team. With Liverpool still trailing City by one point with 4 games remaining for each team
it looks unlikely that they will be caught. Liverpool's only hope is Aston Villa who has former Liverpool players Coutinho and Gerrard who will most certainly be up for
helping their former team win the title.</p>
